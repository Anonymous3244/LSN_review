In the experiment, the parameters of the Black-Scholes equation are set as follows:   $\Omega = (0,20)$, and $T = 1$.  The volatility $\sigma$ and the risk-free interest rate $r$ are selected a subset of parameters that cover both small and large differences  to ensure a representative evaluation. The dataset comprises $50$ internal points and $2000$ boundary points. The neural network architecture is designed with a depth of $9$ layers and a width of $50$ neurons. The Lie symmtery operator is $G_2$. The training iteration is $200,000$, with a learning rate of $lr = 0.001$ and a learning rate decay factor of $\gamma = 0.95$.

## 2. Additional Experiments on Real-Time Market Dataset.

We aimed to extend our analysis to real-time market data, focusing on call options on Nasdaq 100  as underlying assets. The NN model for option pricing relies on two fixed inputs: volatility  and risk-free interest rate. In our experimental setup, we utilized implied volatility sourced from the Optionmetrics dataset. For the risk-free rate, we use the average 1-year Treasury yield over the option period, obtained via web scraping from Yahoo Finance.

## 3. Different Equation for LSN.

We acknowledge testing on a single PDE system is limited. We are expanding experiments to include the Vasicek model and other KDV ($u_t=u_{xxx}+uu_x$)ã€€equations. Notably, in the Vasicek model where LPS's regularization coincides with the PINN loss, LPS fails while LSN remains effective.

## 4. FNO vs. LSN vs. FDM.

We are currently conducting experiments comparing LSN with neural operator approaches (e.g., FNO) and traditional numerical methods (e.g., FDM). Preliminary results show that LSN performs competitively. Using the second-order finite difference as a reference (refer to the table and figures), we found that LSN does not affect the sample complexity. However, the overall accuracy of LSN is higher than that of PINNs.
